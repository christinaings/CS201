# CS201
Coursework done for CS201 at the University of Alabama

Project1 implements a stack and a queue based on a dynamic array and a circular dynamic array, respectively. The queue and stack operate as intended with the appropriate queue, dequeue, push, and pop operations.

Project2 implements a binary search tree. The matilda.c file reads in variables from a file and stores them into the BST (var name and value) and then recieves a mathematical expression at the end. It then evaluates the expression looking up any variables from the BST. If it doesn't find them, it satates so and exits.
